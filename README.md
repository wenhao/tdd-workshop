### tdd-workshop

The TDD and Refactoring Workshop offers a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to 

evolutionary design, clean code and automated testing.

Over the past decade, eXtreme Programming practices like User Stories, Test-Driven 

Development (TDD), Behavior Driven Developer (BDD), Refactoring, Continuous Integration 

and Automation have fundamentally changed software development processes and 

inherently how engineers work.

This workshop explores the foundations of TDD, unit testing, automated refactoring and 

improving the design of legacy code with the help of various patterns, strategies, tools and 

techniques. Students will learn essential test-first approaches via interactive discussions, 

multimedia content, hands-on exercises and quizzes.

#### Learning Outcomes

* Understand the thought process and steps involved during a typical test-driven session.
* Drive the development (design and implementation) of a User Story using automated tests.
* Discover improved confidence and increase in development speed by writing automated tests first!
* Identify poorly designed code by using our elaborate code smell vocabulary.
* Learn various automated refactoring techniques and strategies to carefully clean the identified code smells.
* Practice key techniques to break coupling between classes and micro-test each component independently.
* Incrementally transform complex and difficult classes into readable, well-structured, and well-designed code, while keeping them running at all times.
